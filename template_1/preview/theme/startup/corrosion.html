                            One of the methods to measure the rate of corrosion indirectly occurring in the pipe is by using sacrificial coupon technique, wherein pieces of metal with the same/ similar material as the pipe installed in order to experience the same corrosion process as experienced by the pipe. The corrosion rate is measured and read from the weight loss of the coupon installed during the period of time in the pipeline.
                        <br>
                            Feature: 3 "coupon strip is used to measure the rate of corrosion in small sized pipes while 6" coupon strip are for large size pipes. 3 "coupon is used to measure the rate of scaling in pipes of small size, 6" coupon in pipes of large size. Multiple disc ladder coupon and coupon strips are used to measure the corrosion rate in the flow line which consists of more than one phase (oil / gas, oil / water or oil / gas / water).
                            <br>
                            Function: To obtain corrosion rate data operators must periodically pull the plug, and the corrosion rate data will be obtained after the coupon is analyzed in the laboratory. Very effective to determine the type of corrosion that occurs in the pipes, to know the cause of corrosion and are often used in the selection of material

                    <p>
                    On line retrieval of corrosion coupon and replacement of corrosion probes is essential for effective corrosion monitoring of continuous process. Retriever and service valve tools are designed to provide this capability when used with the two inch system access fittings. The retrieval tool is available with 3600 psi pressure rating and a variety of lengths to suit the corrosion coupon holder and probe lengths to be retrieved.
                    <br>
                    Model TKS R retriever and TKS K service valve tools can be used for any KOROSI SPECINDO two inch system access fittings. The major components of the retriever are a stationary inner barrel, thread adapter, moveable stainless steel outer barrel, mandrel rod and socket adapter assembly which are in
                    accordance to NACE MR0175/ISO15156-1. Sealing within the unit is achieved with viton oring,teflon back up rings and graphite impregnated teflon seals. A bleed valve assembly incorporated in the retriever allows product bleed-off away from the operator for safety and cleanliness. It can be also used for back pressuring and product sampling. 
                    <br>
                    The TKS R-retriever operates using pressure balance principle ensuring that it extends and collapses in a safe and easily controlled way. Balance is achieved by equalizing valve and ports. Careful maintenance is essential to obtain maximum life from the equipment. Tools and valves should be dismantled and cleaned after each use and seals should be replaced regularly. Seals and spare parts are available to provide the necessary minor and major overhauls. The TKS R-retriever assembly is equipped with service tools and supply of spare parts.
                    <br>
                    These tool kits are contained in a sturdy box to provide easy storage and portability. The retriever with standard stroke lengths are indicated below and longer stroke length is available on special order basis.

                    <p>
                    Featuring enhanced resolution, intrinsically safe and the ability to obtain metal loss/corrosion rate reading on a conventional ER/LPR probe, the DCI data logger, model DCI-Dx,(with a weather-proof
                    enclosure) or model DCI-Dx-d (with an explosive-proof enclosure) is a fixed instrument for field
                    mounting to record corrosion activity detected by passive measuring probes with output of electrical
                    resistance or linear polarization resistance. The DCI data logger is available with two options, single
                    channel or four channels. Collected data is stored on board backed up by lithium battery for later
                    retrieval by the handheld up loader, model KSHHU
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile, the DCI transmitter is a field mounted instrument capable of transmitting data to
                    control room via options of serial protocol RS-488, analog 4-20 mA current loop or HART protocol. The
                    DCI transmitter with 4-20 mA data communication, however, only transmits metal loss/corrosion rate
                    data without time and temperature data.
                    <br>
                    The DCI data logger/transmitter is certified intrinsically safe for hazardous area operation. The DCI
                    Transmitter is housed in a weather-proof enclosure, model DCI-Tx , or explosive-proof enclosure, model DCI-Tx-d
                    <br>
                    The probe cable is connected through a water-tight cable gland. Hence, the DCI
                    data logger/transmitter is suitable for use in almost any indoor and outdoor environment.
                    Setup of the DCI data logger/transmitter during preliminary installation for a new probe can be
                    Done using the KSHHU. Temperature measurement is feasible with dual ER/temperature and
                    LPR/temperature probes.
